        <br>set basic LAN attribute£¬ you can choose "Get IP from DHCP" or "Use Static IP" to set IP address
1. Use Static IP:  you can set IP address by yourself; in this pattern, you should set IP address, subnet and you can 
set default gateway address. all this three value should be input in dotted-decimal format, which like xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
in addition , you'd batter make sure that  there is no network device with the same IP address in your LAN to avoid 
address conflict.

2. Get IP from DHCP£ºget IP address by DHCP£»in this pattern £¬default gateway setting is invalid and you should aslo 
set retry count; while in the retry count AP can not get IP address successfully , AP should use the latest IP address that 
valid in "Use Static IP" pattern.  using DHCP get IP address can avoid address conflict effectively.  there should be a DHCP 
server in the LAN.
