        <br>STP(spanning-tree protocol), is a data link control protocol in data link Data Link Control Layer. it can avoid loop circuit of data link, and 
at the same time it aslo support backup of data link. 
the essence of  STP is to make a agreement in the exchange of network topology into a tree in order to avoid the  loop circuit

1.AP Bridge Priority: this value used to determine the network topology of the root bridge; the smaller the value is,  the more chance 
it become the root bridge.
2.set Bridge Forward Delay: to stay in each port to listen to and learn the status of the time
3.set hello time:  send Hello message interval
4.set max message age£ºTime the existence of BPDU message, over a specified period of time did not receive a new BPDU, then 
re-run elections spanning tree algorithm
5.STP:  Whether the STP-enabled devices function
