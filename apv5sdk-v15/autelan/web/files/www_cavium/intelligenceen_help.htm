		<br>monitoring AP performance to find out circumstances like uplink exception, signal exception and so on ,and adjust the AP 
automaticly to  optimize the performance of AP

uplink detect: checking the uplink network, and let's all VAP down if AP can not keep in touch with the uplink network. this detect
include two forms: uplink-interface-detect and uplink-network-detect
uplink-interface-detect : monitor eth interface linked to uplink network. And judge can not keep in touch with uplink if link status down
(PS: there should be only one eth interface can use policy link-off or access-off ,all others should use ignore policy )
1. When eth[n] disable£ºpolicy used when interface eth[n] down. when use "ignore" policy, AP will do nothing ,and down all VAP if use "link-off"
policy; while use "access-off" policy, AP refuse any wireless terminal 's link request but do not down VAP
2. Auto Detect Interval: interval of detecting . And AP will stop detecting when set value to zero
uplink-netwrok-detect: if AP can not keep in touch with the IP address you appointed, we judge the AP aslo can not keep in touch with uplink
network 
1.Up Link IP Address£ºIP address used to check uplink network access capability
2. Auto Detect Interval: interval of detecting . And AP will stop detecting when set value to zero

Channel Auto Adjust£ºif there are APs using the same channel , the AP should try to find out a clean channel(least AP use this channel)  
1.Auto Adjust Channel On wifi[n]£ºchange the current wifi£¨n is indentity of wifi , which start from zero£©.
2. Auto Detect Interval: interval of detecting . And AP will stop detecting when set value to zero

txpower Auto Adjust£ºif there are APs using the same channel , the AP should change txpower according to the policy you appointed
1.Auto Adjust Power On wifi[n]£ºchange current wifi 's txpower , and appoint the policy using for change£¨n is indentity of wifi , which start from zero£©.   
2. Auto Detect Interval: interval of detecting . And AP will stop detecting when set value to zero
